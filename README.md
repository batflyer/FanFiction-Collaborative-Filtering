### INTRODUCTION

"Link Prediction" is a task where you have been given known relationships between entities, relationships, and attributes in a relational database, and the goal is to learn the structure and infer whether a relationship (a link) should exist between two other entities.

### BACKGROUND

FanFiction.Net was established in 1998 and is among the world's largest collection of user-submitted fanfiction (works of fiction authored by fans of existing stories, such as movies, books, or TV shows). The large amount of easily-available user content has drawn interest from those interested in analyzing the content and creative differences between original works and their fanfiction derivatives [1]. More recently, [2] created an anonymized dataset of the metadata from fanfiction sources.
