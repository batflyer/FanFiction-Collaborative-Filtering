I got into fanfiction in the early 2000s, starting with Code Lyoko and branching out into a couple different communities. Even back then it occurred to me that finding fanfiction was not entirely straightforward: FanFiction.Net organized stories according to what was recently updated, so finding fanfiction you enjoyed tended to be done by reading people's blogs or following authors whose work was consistently good.

FanFiction.Net does maintain a search engine, but it is mostly based on searching metadata (things like length, canon, main characters, story genre), or keywords in the summary. More powerful search engines have been undertaken by the community, the [Scryer Advanced Search Engine](https://scryer.darklordpotter.net) is a great example that can search through stories in some of the top fandoms.

But these fall short of what many search engines do: full document search with *content-based filtering* and *collaborative filtering*.

This is what I aim to provide here: a modern search engine for the FanFiction.Net community.
