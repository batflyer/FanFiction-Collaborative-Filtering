\section{Introduction}
A ``fanfic'' is a creative work where an author adapts or extends an existing work of fiction.

\section{Background}

FanFiction has been observed through a variety of academic lenses; such as psychology, sociology, and computer science. Though a variety of fields have taken interest in the subject, many contend that the subject is poorly understood within academic literature, or point out that attempts to analyze FanFiction communities in the past have been performed in disruptive manners \cite{larsen2011fandom}. \cite{barnes2015fanfiction} noted that the subject at the time of writing had almost entirely been understood from a qualitative standpoint.

Within the last few years has there been an increase in large-scale computational analyses. \cite{milli2016beyond} compared fanfiction with the source (canon) text that stories originated from, sentiment analysis on the reviews, and predicted how readers would respond to characters in a chapter. \cite{yin2017no} published an anonymized set of metadata, and presented evidence that the majority of users were English-speaking students based on the time of year FanFiction.Net users were most active.
